OLD STRsimulator Versions

- first version was: "simulator.py"
  -  the "getBedFile"-function here can deal with bed-files from ucsc which has more columns, and creates a bedfile-list instead of the dictionary of the final version
  the difference of list and dictionary has only minimal effect on the runtime. Biggest issue in the runtime is the fasta-reader/written, and the lacking threads.
